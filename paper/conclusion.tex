\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents the design of a scalable overlay facility for data
aggregation in datacenter network environment.  Our design achieves scalability
across a large number of nodes through the use of multiple independent
aggregation trees and efficient data compaction.  The system is adaptive to
heterogeneous data sources, and is resilient to failures.  An initial
simulation study shows encouraging performance results, and helps us understand
the characteristics of the system.
